# gf-dbdelete

gf-dbdelete is a command-line tool designed to provide a standardized interface for deletion of existing rows from tables in a data source. By utilizing a JSON-based input format and providing consistent functionality across data sources.

## Usage

```sh
gf-dbdelete <driver> <data-source>
gf-dbdelete -h | --help
```

To use gf-dbdelete with Spanner, specify `spanner` as the `<driver>` and provide a string in the format `projects/<project>/instances/<instance>/databases/<database>` as the `<data-source>`. In this format, `<project>` represents the name of your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, `<instance>` is the name of your Spanner instance in the GCP project, and `<database>` is the name of the database within the Spanner instance.

To use gf-dbdelete with SQLite3, set `sqlite3` as the `<driver>` and provide a connection string as the `<data-source>`.
The connection string should follow the format described in [https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#connection-string](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3#connection-string), such as `file:test.db?cache=shared&mode=memory`.

## Input

gf-dbdelete expects a JSON array as input from stdin. The JSON array should have the following structure `DBDeleteInput`:

```ts
// list of the table names to be deleted. The rows in the tables that come earlier are deleted before the rows in the tables that come later.
type DBDeleteInput = string[]
```

Here's an example:
```sh
[ "Comment", "User" ]
```

In this example, the JSON input instructs gf-dbdelete to delete existing rows in the Comment table first, followed by the rows in the User table.
